;;Exercise 2.3. Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of exercise 2.2.) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now implement a different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures will work using either representation?

(define (make-point n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (if (or (and (> n 0) (> d 0))
	    (and (< n 0) (< d 0)))
	(cons (abs (/ n g)) (abs (/ d g)))
	(cons (- (abs (/ n g))) (abs (/ d g)))	
	)))

(define (x-point point)
    (car point))

(define (y-point point)
    (cdr point))

(define (add-rat x y)
  (make-point (+ (* (x-point x) (y-point y))
               (* (x-point y) (y-point x)))
            (* (y-point x) (y-point y))))

(define (div-rat x y)
  (make-point (* (x-point x) (y-point y))
            (* (y-point x) (x-point y))))
